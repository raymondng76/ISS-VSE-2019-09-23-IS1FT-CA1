## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Our group is working on the YOLO v3 object detection model and implementation. The algorithm “You Only Look Once” is first published in May 2016 , proposing a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) that passes the image once through the network to predict multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities, terming it the unified model. It not only proposed to speed up current object detection models, but reasons globally in the context of the image instead of the previous sliding window or region-based techniques. Lastly, it is designed to learn the generalized representation of objects, which then allows for it to be retrained and applied to new domains and do not break as easily when provided unseen inputs.
This proposal is later updated twice, first to the YOLO9000 , otherwise commonly known as YOLO v2, and then again to YOLO v3 tech report  in 2018. 
Our report focuses on the application of YOLO v3 and how it can be utilized together with OpenCV instead of the previous generations of the same object detection model. We will lightly touch on the main differences but gear more towards how the object detection model can be used for training your own datasets and its pitfalls, and most importantly our own YOLO v3 API implementation and its workings.
